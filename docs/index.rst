   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Welcome to AnisongDB's documentation!
=====================================

Eh, for now just a simple database for Anisong, J-pop, J-rock, 
games, and doujin music. Maybe more in the future.

Some features that are currently planned 
- simple search by track or artist
- easy to add new tracks
